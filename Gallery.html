        <p>I was introduced to web development through curiosity 
            and a bit of necessity. It all began when I stumbled across a basic HTML
             tutorial while trying to create a simple personal blog. Intrigued by how lines<br>
              of code could transform into a functioning webpage, I dove deeper. I started with HTML and CSS,
               experimenting with colors, fonts, and layouts. Soon, I discovered JavaScript and realized how 
               interactivity could bring a site to life. Each new skill felt like unlocking a new superpower, and<br> 
               I was hooked. What started as a casual interest quickly turned into a passion, shaping the way I view 
               technology and creativity today.</p>

                <h2>How I Became a Software Developer</h2>
<p>  

    My journey to becoming a software developer was a blend of curiosity, persistence, and a passion for problem-solving.
     It all started with a fascination for technology and the way it shapes our world.
      I remember tinkering with computers and wondering how programs worked behind the scenes.  
    
    Driven by this curiosity, I began exploring programming through online tutorials and coding challenges. 
    Starting with the basics of Python, I fell in love with how logic and creativity combined to solve problems.
     From there,
     I learned more languages and frameworks, building small projects like to-do apps and simple games.  
    
    What truly solidified my path was a project that solved a real-world issue for my community.
     Seeing people use something I created inspired me to pursue software development as a career. 
     Formal studies and practical experience further honed my skills, 
     and I embraced opportunities to collaborate on larger projects.  
    
    Becoming a software developer wasn’t just about learning to code—it was about perseverance, embracing challenges,
     and a constant desire to learn and improve. Today,
      it feels incredible to be part of an ever-evolving field that shapes the future.</p>
